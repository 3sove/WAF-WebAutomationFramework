# WAF-WebAutomationFramework
# About

WAF (Web Automation Framework) is GUI test automation framework that can automate testing performance and simplify as much of the testing effort as possible with a minimum set of scripts. Framework is developed under dot net environment using C# language and open source Selenium WebDriver framework libraries to automate web UI elements. 

WAF designed to perform automation testing using different browser under different environment, different screen resolution and produce test results into html document.

Web Automation framework is way to organize the code so that it can be:

•	Reusable
•	Scalable
•	Maintainable
•	Understandable
•	Workable

1.2	Reusable

DSS WAF (Web Automation Framework) is developed that can be used by multiple users across same or multiple projects, not limited to one single project.
Using framework can reduce the effort spent on “X” component (library of code) which is already written or available, and by reusing the code will require less or no testing since the available code is not all new since its already in use.

1.3	Scalable

Framework is scalable, meaning it can be used for small to large projects. Framework is scaled to support multiple technologies and tools that can be web or widows even service based.

1.4	Maintainable

Framework is easily maintainable since it is written in same dot net environment that developers develop DSS Web application. Framework code is segregated as a logical groups of same type (classes) and functionalities (methods).
Framework will have master that will be different entity from working project, so that changes to framework will go to framework projects then changes to test goes to test project.

1.5	Understandable

Framework is usable and understandable by any QA team that can be pluggable to any project even less knowledge automation test engineer will work with code using framework methods.
